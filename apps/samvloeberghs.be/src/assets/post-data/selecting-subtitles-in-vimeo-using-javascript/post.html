    At <a href="https://sponsormatch.eu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SponsorMatch</a> we deploy an Angular
    Universal website & application that is shown in different languages. Currently we support Dutch (nl) and
    English (en). On the homepage we use a simple introduction video / explainimation that is hosted on
    <a href="https://vimeo.com/231377016" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Vimeo</a> to show how the product
    works. This animation video is made in English but for the Dutch-speaking market we provided Dutch subtitles.
  </p>

  <h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
  <p>
    It seems that it's not possible to set the default selected subtitle using the Vimeo iframe embed solution. It's
    probably possible but anyway, I couldn't find any information on Google or on the Vimeo documentation. There are
    even some questions on StackOverflow that remained unanswered for years:
  </p>

      </a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
  <p>
    There are several solutions possible and one is moving completely to the JavaScript API Vimeo provides. More
    information can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/vimeo/player.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/vimeo/player.js</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    The second solution I used was combining the iframe embed solution with the JS API. Basically we just use the
    iframe that was used for embedding as parameter in the Player constructor:
  </p>

  <h2 id="using-it-in-angular">Using it in Angular</h2>

  <p>
    Using it in Angular is fairly easy.. We need to install the @vimeo/player package using yarn or npm:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="language-sh line-numbers">npm i -s @vimeo/player</code></pre>

  <p>
    Next we can import the Player directly and by using the <code>enableTextTrack</code> function we can easily set the
    language. As developers / implementors I
    believe we should be responsible in some way for knowing which languages are available to use. Meaning: which
    subtitles / texttracks are implemented on the embedded video.
  </p>

  <h4 class="codetitle">enable-text-track.ts</h4>
  <pre><code class="language-ts line-numbers">import Player from '@vimeo/player';
const player = new Player(document.getElementById('intro_explanimation'));

player.enableTextTrack(this.language, 'subtitles').then(function (track) {
    // track contains language, kind and label
}).catch(function (error) {
    // error holds what happened in detail
});</code></pre>

  <p>
    Please take a look at the full example below. The end result is implemented on the homepage of <a
    href="https://sponsormatch.eu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SponsorMatch</a>.
