    This post is targeted to webdevelopers that are creating <em>offline-capable applications</em> and more specifically
    offline-capable applications that can be categorized as SPAs or Single Page Applications. I will share some of my
    lessons learned, not just to share them, but also to maybe <em>get feedback from interested readers</em> that might
    have found other ways or used other methods to solve the problems described.

  <h2 id="serve-the-index-html-for-all-deeplinks-while-offline">Serve the <code>index.html</code> for all deeplinks (while offline)</h2>

  <p>
    While developing SPA applications we often, if not always, leverage the power of routing. <strong>When we go offline
    we need to make sure that all routes keep working</strong>. An example:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      The entry point of a visitor of your application was the <code>/about</code> page. The server knows that for every
      hit on your website, it has to return the <code>index.html</code> file.
    </li>
    <li>
      After a while, this user returns to your website, but he enters directly via the <code>/contact</code> page with a
      refresh or via some link on any other website.
    </li>
    <li>
      For some reason your application is now offline, or the user has lost connectivity during this navigation.
      Your service worker kicks in, tries to lookup the <code>/about</code> page in the cache, but has no hit, because
      the only static file cached is the <code>index.html</code> file.
    </li>
    <li>
      Your service worker somehow needs to know which file to service for these type of requests
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Using Workbox this can easily be done by checking if the request was of <code>mode</code>
    "navigate" and if so, serve the single <code>index.html</code> file. This <code>index.html</code> file should
    already be cached with workbox as a static asset so we request it from the <code>precache</code>.
  </p>

  <h4 class="codetitle">sw.js</h4>
  <pre><code class="language-js line-numbers">// default page handler for offline usage,
// where the browser does not how to handle deep links
// it's a SPA, so each path that is a navigation should default to index.html
workbox.routing.registerRoute(
  ({ event }) => event.request.mode === 'navigate',
  async () => {
    const defaultBase = '/index.html';
    return caches
      .match(workbox.precaching.getCacheKeyForURL(defaultBase))
      .then(response => {
          return response || fetch(defaultBase);
      })
      .catch(err => {
        return fetch(defaultBase);
      });
  }
);</code></pre>

  <p>
    This logic gives you <em>quicker offline and online usages</em>, because even when your user is
    online the service worker will use the cached <code>index.html</code>, when for example opening a new tab with a
    different page of your application.
  </p>

  <h3 id="shortcut-available">Shortcut available</h3>

  <p>
    Workbox gives you a shortcut and extra options for this behaviour, like whitelisting and blacklisting by exposing
    the <code>registerNavigationRoute</code> handler on the <code>routing</code> module.
  </p>

  <h4 class="codetitle">sw.js</h4>
  <pre><code class="language-js line-numbers">workbox.routing.registerNavigationRoute(
  // Assuming '/single-page-app.html' has been precached,
  // look up its corresponding cache key.
  workbox.precaching.getCacheKeyForURL('/single-page-app.html'), {
    whitelist: [
      new RegExp('/blog/')
    ],
    blacklist: [
      new RegExp('/blog/restricted/'),
    ]
  }
);
</code></pre>

  <p class="alert alert--warning">
    Please also keep in mind that this reflects the behavior of the server in case of a SPA setup. <strong>For all requests
    not matching a static resource like an image, or a dynamic resource like an API, the server should return the <code>index.html</code> file</strong>!
  </p>

  <h2 id="dont-just-blindly-use-skip-waiting-or-clients-claim">Don't just blindly use <code>skipWaiting()</code> or <code>clients.claim()</code></h2>

  <p>
    Using <code>skipWaiting()</code> or <code>clients.claim()</code> should not be done blindly and without thought.
    Unfortunately there are many articles on the internet that just instruct you to do it without much more information.
    The fact that you have to be careful about this is also clearly mentioned in "<a
    href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/lifecycle"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener">Service Worker Lifecycle</a>", an article by Jake Archibald.
  </p>

  <p class="alert alert--quote">
    <em>Note:</em> I see a lot of people including <code>clients.claim()</code> as boilerplate, but I rarely do so
    myself. It only
    really matters on the very first load, and due to progressive enhancement the page is usually working happily
    without service worker anyway.
  </p>

  <h3 id="what-could-possibly-go-wrong">What could possibly go wrong?</h3>

  <p>
    There are several scenarios where just calling <code>skipWaiting()</code> or <code>clients.claim()</code> blindly in
    your service worker <em>could be the cause of unexpected and harmful side effects</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    One possible scenario is that the code functionality in your application could not match anymore with
    the logic in your service worker. So it might impose a breaking change. <strong>Let's consider a short step-by-step
    example</strong>:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>The browser has your application code, including the code that registers your service worker and the service
      worker,
      cached
    </li>
    <li>When loading the application, this cached content is served and loads your new service worker with updated
      functionality, updates the precached content and finally skips the waiting process and claims the clients
      available
    </li>
    <li>
      Your user now has the old application loaded in his browser, but using the new service worker functionality,
      which is potentially problematic!
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    So it's important to always <em>make sure that the loaded version of the logic of your application is working nicely
    together with the loaded version of the logic of your service worker</em>.
  </p>

  <h3 id="service-worker-active-during-first-time-usage-of-your-app">Service worker active during first-time usage of your application</h3>

  <p>
    Not calling <code>skipWaiting()</code> or <code>clients.claim()</code> could be problematic for your use case,
    especially if you want your service worker to be active from the very
    first time you load your application. Let's take a basic example to explain this situation:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Your application imports a 3rd party library that sends requests to a server.
      The URLs these requests have to be sent to are configurable, but the headers used for these requests aren't.
      You may want to add an <code>Authorization</code> header to each of these requests made.
    </li>
    <li>
      One of the possible strategies to use could be to setup a service worker that acts as a proxy and adds this header
      to all relevant requests.
    </li>
    <li>
      This functionality has to work from the very first time, but you might think this is not possible without
      <code>skipWaiting()</code> and/or <code>clients.claim()</code>.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    The only way I found so far is by checking if your page already has a service worker that is activated, or is in the
    process of changing his state to activated, but no new version of the service worker is waiting to be activated. In
    that case we can assume there was no previous service worker available. Now we can automatically reload the page as
    soon as the service worker activated.
  </p>

  <h4 class="codetitle">service-worker-registration.ts</h4>
  <pre><code class="language-ts line-numbers">// Check that service workers are available
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {

    // Use the window load event to keep the page load performant
    window.addEventListener('load', () => {

    navigator.serviceWorker
      .register('/sw.js')
      .then(registration => {

        if (navigator.serviceWorker.controller) {
          // let the application know our service worker is ready
          window['serviceWorkerReady'] = true;
          window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('service-worker-ready'));
        }

        // A wild service worker has appeared in reg.installing and maybe in waiting!
        const newWorker = registration.installing;
        const waitingWoker = registration.waiting;

        if (newWorker) {
          if (newWorker.state === 'activated' && !waitingWoker) {
            // reload to avoid skipWaiting and clients.claim()
            window.location.reload();
          }
          newWorker.addEventListener('statechange', (e) => {
            // newWorker.state has changed
            if (newWorker.state === 'activated' && !waitingWoker) {
              // reload to avoid skipWaiting and clients.claim()
              window.location.reload();
            }
          });
        }

      })
      .catch(err => {
        console.log('service worker could not be registered', err);
      });

  });

}</code></pre>

  <p>
    The drawback is that the first time-use might show a flicker. This side-effect can be minimized by delaying the
    bootstrapping of your application until you know that a service worker is active and show a loading / splash screen
    instead. This is anyway already a requirement, as explained before.

    When building your application and thinking about its offline strategies you should definitely consider what you are

  </p>

  <p>
    This will most probably always be enough space for applications running in a browser on a desktop or laptop. But if
    you're building a content-heavy application on a tablet or phone with limited storage, this might quickly become a
    problem..
  </p>
  <p>
    Imagine a tablet with 32GB of space, while there is only 3GB left as available space, because of for example
    pictures, music and captured videos.
    This means that for your application, on this tablet there is only 6% available of 3GB, which is ~184 MB.
  </p>
  <p>
    While 184 MB might still seem like a great enough amount of space, you have to consider the possibility it might not
    be enough,
    especially if you are caching large files or assets from other domains (CORS) or opaque responses. Dealing with
    opaque requests can be tricky as highlighted in the article <a
    href="https://cloudfour.com/thinks/when-7-kb-equals-7-mb/"

  </p>

  <p>
    In general, we want to avoid hitting a <code>DOMException: Quota exceeded</code> as this might potentially break our
    complete service-worker functionality or offline capabilities.
  </p>
  <p>
    Workbox allows us to cleanup our caches automatically using various methods. We can <em>invalidate caches for a
    specific route handler after an amount of time</em> and we can <em>gracefully purge our cache on quota errors</em>.
  </p>

);</code></pre>

  <h2 id="avoid-using-global-state-in-the-service-worker">Avoid using global state in the service worker</h2>

  <p>
    I've learned this one the hard way, by debugging and debugging and debugging till I got crazy and started searching
    the internet. Let me first explain my use case, which is in fact the origin of the <code>Authorization</code> header
    example above.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>The application that we are developing includes 3rd party libraries like <code><a href="https://openlayers.org/"
                                                                                          target="_blank"
                                                                                          rel="noopener">openlayers</a></code>
      to give us very nice dynamic map functionalities.
    </li>
    <li>
      The URLs this library uses to load the map-tiles is configurable, but the headers aren't. We needed to be able to
      add an <code>Authorization</code> header on the requests made to these URLs and using a service-worker for this
      seemed reasonable.
    </li>
    <li>
      As soon as we log in, we pass the token to the service worker, using the <code>BroadcastChannel</code> API and
      we store it in a global variable <code>let oAuthToken</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Every time our service worker sees a request for the map-tiles, we proxy the requests and add the token as a
      header to the request so our server/backend can successfully authorize the request.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="what-was-going-wrong">Now what was going wrong?</h3>

  <p>
    It seems that service workers are potentially stopped and restarted multiple times in their lifetime because of
    <a
      href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38835273/when-does-code-in-a-service-worker-outside-of-an-event-handler-run/38835274#38835274"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">several optimizations like battery saving algorithms</a>. <strong>Stopping and
    restarting destroys and
    reinitializes the global scope of our service worker</strong>! So our global variable holding the token was gone,
    resulting in requests that did
    not authorize properly.
  </p>

  <h3 id="so-how-to-correctly-share-the-token">So how to correctly share the <code>OAuthToken</code> with the service worker?</h3>

  <p>
    The only way to successfully share the <code>OAuthToken</code> from our application logic with our service worker
    logic is by using the <code>IndexedDB</code> API. The library I use to simplify IndexedDB access in my service
    worker is <code><a
    href="https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb-keyval" target="_blank" rel="noopener">idb-keyval</a></code>.
    If you need more advanced logic you can checkout <code><a href="https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb"
                                                              target="_blank" rel="noopener">idb</a></code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In our example below, we assume that somehow our application has saved a token in the IndexedDB.
    Using workbox we register a <code>RegExp</code> for any route we want to authenticate using our token. Let's go trough the example, step by step:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      We register a route, in this case to trap all the requests going to <code>map.png</code>
    </li>
    <li>
      In the capture function of the route registration, the first parameter, a check is done to see if we have a token available in the IndexedDB.
    </li>
    <li>
      If a token is available, we modify the request in the handler, the second parameter, and add the token as an <code>Authorization</code> header.
    </li>
    <li>
      If no token is available, we return a replacement resource, the <code>not_authorized.png</code> image, which has
      been cached already in our precaching setup.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <pre><code class="language-js line-numbers">// OAuth header interceptor
workbox.routing.registerRoute(
  ({ url }) => {
    return /map\.png/.test(url);
  },
  async ({ event, url }) => {

    // get the eventual token
    const customStore = new Store('swl-db', 'swl-db-store');
    const oAuthToken = await get<string>('token', customStore);

    // if token available, set it as the Authorization header
    if (!!oAuthToken) {
      const modifiedHeaders = new Headers(event.request.headers);
      modifiedHeaders.set('Authorization', oAuthToken);
      const overwrite = {
        headers: modifiedHeaders
      };
      const modifiedRequest = new Request(url.toString(), overwrite);
      return fetch(modifiedRequest);
    }

    const defaultNotAuthedBase = '/assets/not_authorized.png';
    return caches
      .match(workbox.precaching.getCacheKeyForURL(defaultNotAuthedBase))
      .then(response => {
        return response || fetch(defaultNotAuthedBase);
      })
      .catch(err => {
        return fetch(defaultNotAuthedBase);
      });

  }
);
</code></pre>

  <p class="alert alert--info">
    A possible extension for this functionality would be to check if the status code of the response coming from the
    server is as expected, for example a <code>200 OK</code>. If not a valid or expected response code, return the cached <code>not_authorized.png</code> image.
  </p>

  <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

  <p>
    When developing SPAs with offline capabilities, we need to make sure that our service worker is acting the same way
    as our server. <strong>For routing requests or navigations, the service worker should always return the <code>index.html</code>
    to keep deeplinking working when offline</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Don't just blindly use <code>skipWaiting()</code> or <code>clients.claim()</code>, but think about the possible side
    effects it could introduce. Instead, <strong>let the user decide when to upgrade the functionality</strong> or let a
    new version be
    applied automatically on a sub-sequent load of your application.
  </p>
  <p>
    Be careful with what you cache offline and which devices your application will be used upon. <strong>The available
    space for
    your application depends on the free space of the device and the browser where the application is loaded.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Don't depend on global variables or state in your service worker as <strong>service workers are potentially
    destroyed and bootstrapped several times during their lifetime</strong>.
    Use IndexedDB to share state from your application with your service worker.
