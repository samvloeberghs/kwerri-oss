  <h2 id="target-audience">Target audience</h2>

  <p>
    This article is intented to help anybody using Nx workspaces.
    <strong>These instructions are based on the latest version of Nx</strong>, at the time
    of writing <code>16.5.5</code>.  They could work for earlier / later versions, but might need some tweaking in the configuration.
  </p>

  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    Each project (app or library) in an Nx workspace comes with different commands, or targets, that can be executed.
    For example to <code>build</code>, <code>test</code> or <code>lint</code> your project, just to give the 3 most common examples.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you use task executors, all apps and libraries in an Nx workspace come with a <code>project.json</code> file
    that holds
    configuration for these commands for each individual project. If you use npm scripts, the configuration will mostly be in the
    <code>package.json</code> file of the projects. Anyway, Nx will always merge the two files to come to the full
    project
    configuration.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because every project, app or library, has similar configuration for its targets, <strong>it can sometimes become
    cumbersome to keep the configuration up-to-date across all of them</strong>. Especially if you have a lot of libraries, which is very common.
    Instead of defining the same configuration acros all of our projects, we can <strong>leverage target defaults so that we don't need to maintain the same configuration everywhere</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2 id="example-setup">Example Setup</h2>

  <p>
    Let's start with an example setup where we have different feature libraries. Each feature library holds the
    source code
    for a specific section of our application. Let's keep it simple and use a CMS as an example. In this CMS we will
    be managing
    <strong>products</strong>, <strong>sales</strong> and <strong>clients</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3 id="library-setup">Library setup</h3>

  <p>
    So we have 3 feature libraries; <code>feature-products</code>, <code>feature-sales</code> and <code>feature-clients</code>.
    For each of these libraries we generated a storybook setup. So all of them have the same
    <code>project.json</code> that looks something like this:
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-json line-numbers">{
    "name": "feature-products",
    "$schema": "../../../node_modules/nx/schemas/project-schema.json",
    "projectType": "library",
    "sourceRoot": "libs/feature-products/src",
    "prefix": "sv-fp",
    "targets": {
    "test": {
        "executor": "@nx/jest:jest",
        "outputs": ["{workspaceRoot}/coverage/{projectRoot}"],
        "options": {
            "jestConfig": "libs/feature-products/jest.config.ts",
            "passWithNoTests": true
        }
    },
    "lint": {
        "executor": "@nx/linter:eslint",
        "options": {
            "lintFilePatterns": [
                "libs/feature-products/**/*.ts",
                "libs/feature-products/**/*.html"
            ]
        }
    },
    "storybook": {
        "executor": "@storybook/angular:start-storybook",
        "options": {
            "port": 4400,
            "configDir": "libs/feature-products/.storybook",
            "browserTarget": "feature-products:build-storybook",
            "compodoc": false
        },
        "configurations": {
            "ci": {
                "quiet": true
            }
        }
    },
    "build-storybook": {
        "executor": "@storybook/angular:build-storybook",
        "outputs": ["{options.outputDir}"],
        "options": {
            "outputDir": "dist/feature-reports",
            "configDir": "libs/feature-products/.storybook",
            "browserTarget": "feature-products:build-storybook",
            "compodoc": false
        },
        "configurations": {
            "ci": {
                "quiet": true
            }
        }
    },
    "tags": ["type:feature"]
}</code></pre>

  <h3 id="adding-shared-styles">Adding shared styles</h3>

  <img class="float-right"
  style="width: 40%"
         src="/assets/post-data/nx-workspaces-target-defaults/ui-design-system-lib.png"
         alt="UI Design system project library" />
  <p>
    Each of these libraries obviously have their own set of css styling, but like with any other project there are some shared styles, for example typography or color-schemes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Imagine those styles are defined within the "Design System" UI library, <code>ui-design-system</code>, located on the same level as the feature libraries.
    The ui library setup looks like the screenshot shown.
  </p>
  <p>
    When running the storybook setup we want to be able to load these styles the same way as we would be running
    the application integrating all of the feature and ui libraries. So we extend the storybook configuration a bit more, by adding the <code>styles</code> and <code>stylePreprocessorOptions</code> options to the <code>build-storybook</code> target in the <code>project.json</code> of all our feature libraries:
  </p>

<pre data-line="7-10,11-13"><code class="language-json line-numbers">{
    // ...
    "build-storybook": {
        "executor": "@storybook/angular:build-storybook",
        "outputs": ["{options.outputDir}"],
        "options": {
            "styles": [
                "libs/ui-design-system/src/lib/styles/_storybook.scss",
                "libs/ui-design-system/src/lib/styles/_main.scss"
            ],
            "stylePreprocessorOptions": {
                "includePaths": ["libs/ui-design-system/src/lib/styles"]
            },
            "outputDir": "dist/storybook/feature-products",
            "configDir": "libs/feature-products/.storybook",
            "browserTarget": "feature-products:build-storybook",
            "compodoc": false
        },
        "configurations": {
            "ci": {
                "quiet": true
            }
        }
    },
    "tags": ["type:feature"]
}</code></pre>

<p>
  On line 7-10 we import some scss files with styles that should be loaded globally. It contains for example the typography and basic styles.
  On line 11-13 we define the import / include paths for the <code>@import</code> statements to use as a base for resolving files.
</p>

<h2 id="using-target-defaults">Using Target Defaults</h2>

<p>
  Imagine having several, 10 or more, applications and hundreds, if not thousands, of feature libraries in your monorepository where we constantly need to add and keep this configuration up-to-date.
  Nearly impossible to not forget it at some places at a first try!
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Target defaults to the rescue!</strong> Instead of defining this same configuration to each <code>project.json</code> we can define it once in the <code>nx.json</code> configuration file (line 13-21):
</p>

<pre data-line="13-21"><code class="language-json line-numbers">{
    // ..
    "$schema": "./node_modules/nx/schemas/nx-schema.json",
    "targetDefaults": {
      "build-storybook": {
          "inputs": [
              "default",
              "^production",
              "{workspaceRoot}/.storybook/**/*",
              "{projectRoot}/.storybook/**/*",
              "{projectRoot}/tsconfig.storybook.json"
          ],
          "options": {
              "styles": [
                  "libs/ui-design-system/src/lib/styles/kor/_storybook.scss",
                  "libs/ui-design-system/src/lib/styles/kor/_main.scss"
              ],
              "stylePreprocessorOptions": {
                  "includePaths": ["libs/ui-design-system/src/lib/styles"]
              }
          }
      },
      // ...
    },
    // ...
}
</code></pre>


<p>
  Nx will now use the default configuration provided if not overwritten at the library / application level.
</p>

    <h2 id="another-example">Another example</h2>

    <p>
      Another, and even more simple example, would be to override the default port to serve your applications to <code>5000</code>.
      To achieve this, the only changes needed to your <code>nx.json</code> file are the following:
    </p>

<pre data-line="5-9"><code class="language-json line-numbers">{
    // ..
    "$schema": "./node_modules/nx/schemas/nx-schema.json",
    "targetDefaults": {
        "serve": {
            "options": {
                "port": 5000
            }
        },
        // ...
    },
    // ...
}
</code></pre>

    <p>
        Every application will now be served on port <code>5000</code> by default, unless you overwrite it in the <code>project.json</code> of the specific application.
    </p>

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
      Repeating yourself is generally considered a bad practice in clean code principles. Especially when the tools give you the power
      to define what you had to repeat for each project on a more global / default level. Just always remember to keep it as simple as you can!
     </p>
     <p>
      In this specific case, we pulled default configuration of storybook up into the global <code>nx.json</code>, which we beforehand added to the <code>project.json</code> for each library separately.
      This makes it easier to maintain for all existing projects (apps and libraries) and will be automatically applied
      to new projects as well.
    </p>
