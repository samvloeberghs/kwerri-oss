  <p>
    This post is a follow-up on my previous post about
    <a href="posts/scully-or-angular-universal-what-is-the-difference" target="_blank">the differences between Angular
      Universal and Scully</a>. In that post I mentioned that Universal can be much faster in the (pre)rendering process
    compared to Scully. <strong>This difference is mainly significant and noticeable in the order of thousands of pages
    and more as we will show.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    When building and maintaining a large website, for example a business directory, <strong>where rerenders are often
    necessary, this can become very important</strong>. If it takes an hour or more to prerender all the pages the data
    might have changed again before the process ended. So let's see how both technologies behave on the same
    application and come up with the actual metrics!
  </p>

  <p class="alert alert--warning">
    <strong>Important:</strong> This post is not intented to break down or bash any of the 2 technologies. I love both
    of them very much and I believe they both have their use case! As a good software engineer you should always try
    to make the best and informed decisions about technology choices, especially if you can base those decisions
    on simple benchmarks!
  </p>

  <h2 id="example-application">Example application</h2>

  <p>
    The example application used for the benchmarks is a simple Angular application, in an Nx monorepo, that has a home
    route, a news overview route and news detail route. The news functionality is loaded via a lazy-loaded angular
    module. You can <a href="https://github.com/samvloeberghs/scully-universal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">find the
    repository here to play with the setup and try your own scenarios</a>.
  </p>

  <img class="extraspace"
       src="/assets/post-data/scully-and-angular-universal-comparing-benchmarks/scully-universal-example-app.gif"
       alt="Scully - Universal - Example app"/>

  <p class="alert alert--info">
    Due to the different implementation details of Universal and Scully the application was build twice, but with the
    same structural setup, markup and styles. This means the code is not completely identical; the only difference is
    the injection of the <code>ScullyLibModule</code> in the Scully application. This difference should not have a
    significant influence on the test results.
  </p>

  <h2 id="benchmarking-details">Benchmarking details</h2>

  <h3 id="test-cases">Test cases</h3>

  <p>
    Scully and Universal will prerender all the pages that are available on the application. These pages include the
    <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/guess-parser" target="_blank" rel="noopener">auto-discovered pages</a> and
    the list of pages that is generated based on the available news data. For Scully, the list of dynamic pages is
    created using <a href="/posts/custom-plugins-for-scully-angular-static-site-generator/#custom-router-plugin" target="_blank">
    a custom routerPlugin</a>. For Universal we used a node script. The result is the same.
  </p>

  <p>
    The HTML render-output will be minified using
    <code><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-minifier" target="_blank" rel="noopener">html-minifier</a></code>.
    The dynamic data, that is loaded on the news overview and detail pages, is inlined in the HTML.
  </p>

  <p>
    We will monitor the time it takes for rendering 100, 1,000 (one thousand) and 10,000 (ten thousand) news detail
    pages with Scully and Universal. Each testcase will be done 3 times and the average of those will be used as the
    final result.
  </p>

  <h3 id="system-environment">System environment</h3>

  <p>
    The benchmarks were executed on my own device, and after a reboot. For reference, here are the system details:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>MBPro 15inch 2018, 2.9Ghz 6core Intel Core i9</li>
    <li>RAM: 32 GB 2400 Mhz DDR4</li>
    <li>Graphics: Radeon Pro 560x 4GB & Intel UHD Graphics 640 1536 MB</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="monitoring-tools-measuring-metrics">Monitoring tools and measuring metrics</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      The execution time is monitored with
      <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gnomon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gnomon</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      The payload is measured with Chrome Devtools > Network
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="running-the-tests">Running the tests</h3>

  <h4>Universal</h4>

  <p>
    We have to serve the application (line 1) while the prerender process is ongoing to be able to load the data for the
    news overview and detail pages. In a separate terminal (line 3) we group the prerendering and minification process
    and pipe it to the <code>gnomon</code> command to measure the execution time.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-bash line-numbers">npx nx serve universal
# parallel terminal
( npm run prerender:universal && npm run minify:universal ) | npx gnomon
</code></pre>

  <h4>Scully</h4>

  <p>
    The same is true for Scully, the data needs to be available so we serve the application in a separate terminal
    (line 1). In the other terminal (line 3) we first do a clean <code>--prod</code> build of the application as the
    Universal process also starts with a clean build. We pass the option <code>--scanRoutes</code> to start with and
    force a clean route discovery process. The final configuration option defines the location of the config file for
    Scully.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-bash line-numbers">npx nx serve scully
# parallel terminal
( npx nx build scully --prod && npx scully --scanRoutes --configFile .scully/scully.scully.config.js ) | npx gnomon
</code></pre>

  <p class="alert alert--info">
    To avoid setting up an API server for this test, I have used <code>news-100.json</code> to represent 100 entries in
    JSON data, <code>news-1000.json</code> for 1,000 entries and <code>news-10000.json</code> for 10,000 entries. For
    testing the different amount of pages we need to modify the reference to <code>news-100.json</code> in the
    <code>scully.scully.config.js</code>, the <code>overview.component.ts</code> and <code>generate-routes.ts</code>
    files.

  <h3 id="general-findings">General findings</h3>

  <p>
    Before we dive into the comparison of the metrics of the different technologies and test-cases, let's first discuss
    some import findings and things to consider.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Execution time will be influenced by other processes running. If you can run the process on a clean and isolated
      node it will give the most stable results.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>The HTML minification process for the Univeral prerendering process can be considered as sub-optimal.
      </strong> There is currently no easy way to directly hook into the process. So we need a separate post-process
      that will do a read and write operation for minifying each HTML file.
    </li>
    <li>
      Both technologies allow for more <strong>smart rerendering</strong> of the prerendered pages. You can build smart
      systems that will only prerender a part of your application, or even only one specific page, after data changes.
      You will always need an initial prerendering of all pages.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="comparing-the-metrics">Comparing the metrics</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Universal is notably faster</strong>, but in the order of 100 pages the differences are neglectable.
      For around 1,000 pages the execution time for Scully triples compared to Universal. For 10,000 of pages Universal
      is a factor ~10 faster.
    </li>
    <li>
      Using <strong>Scully adds around 10kb to the total asset size</strong> of the Angular application. 10kb is not
      little, but with around 1/30 of the total asset size of a very basic application I do no consider this to be
      significant.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="how-to-optimize-scully">How to optimize Scully</h2>

  <p>
    Scully is still in alpha, nearing their first beta release and there will probably follow more internal
    optimizations. However, Scully, using Puppeteer, will never be able to perform as optimal and fast as Universal.
    Let's explore <strong>other ways and techniques to optimize Scully</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3 id="limiting-the-to-render-list-of-pages">Limit the to-render list of pages</h3>

  <p>
    If your application has a lot of pages you definitely need strategies that will only rerender specific pages when
    your content changes. These algorithms can be build in
    <a href="posts/custom-plugins-for-scully-angular-static-site-generator" target="_blank">your own custom router
      plugin</a>. You could for example query a service that will only give back the changed identifiers since a given
    datetime. That way <strong>your list of to render routes will be limited to the updated pages</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another but related technique to the strategy described above is the use of the <code>--baseFilter</code> option. If
    this option is specified only the routes that start with this prefix are taken into account. This way you can
    <strong>prerender only a part of your application routing-tree</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3 id="disable-specific-resource-types">Disable specific resource types</h3>

  <p>
    Using the option <code>--ignoreResourceTypes</code> we can block specific request to
    <a href="https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/puppeteer/v2/index.d.ts#L939">resources</a>
    from happening in Puppeteer when our pages get rendered. This might only slightly decrease the prerendering execution
    time but <strong>potentially dramatically decrease the amounts of data that is loaded</strong> during prerendering.
    The following configuration will block all image, other media, font and stylesheet resources from being loaded.
  </p>

  <h4 class="codetitle">scully.your-project-name.config.js</h4>
  <pre><code class="language-js line-numbers">exports.config = {
    projectRoot: "./apps/&lt;your-project-name&gt;/src",
    projectName: "&lt;your-project-name&gt;",
    outDir: './dist/apps/&lt;your-project-name&gt;-static',
    ignoreResourceTypes: [
      'image',
      'media',
      'font',
      'stylesheet'
    ]
};</code></pre>

  <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Please don't take my writings for granted on this and don't use these metrics for your project</strong>. The
    example application is far from a real-world application, but the concepts and benchmarking process explained can
    easily be applied on your own use-case. <strong>Adding 3rd party libraries or loading a content-heavy and/or
    functionality-heavy page might yield completely different results</strong>. If you are willing to share your
    benchmarking results I would be very happy! :)
  </p>

  <p>
    One thing is for sure though.. If you implement Universal, the prerendering process time will dramaticaly decrease
    (<em>read: be faster</em>) if you are generating pages in amounts of 1000+. If your content is highly volatile but
    you want to keep benefiting from prerendering, consider implementing Universal or at least <strong>apply smart
    rerendering strategies</strong> for your Scully powered application when data changes.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Just because these tests showed that Scully becomes slow in a higher order of amounts of pages, in this
      particular example application, doesn't mean it's bad at what it does</strong>. Scully solves other problems and
    the time/money you might invest on adding Universal support might be more then the extra build and render time
    Scully introduces.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Choose wisely and consider all aspects!</strong> The Scully team is working hard to keep improving. If you
