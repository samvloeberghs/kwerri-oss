  <p>
    This article is intended to help anybody that is looking for ways to call the <code>transform</code> method of
    any Angular Pipe in a component class code or in other TypeScript code.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will also learn about some other simple trick on how to design Angular pipes and how to test them in
    those particular cases.
  </p>

  <h2 id="step-by-step">Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    There are several cases where you would want to reuse the <code>transform</code> functionality of a pipe in your
    component class code. The most simple example is formatting dates in an Angular component's template. The
    <code>DatePipe</code>, provided by the Angular framework itself, is imported in the providers of the component and
    then used by piping the value in the template.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, <code>{{currentDate | date : "fullDate"}}</code> would print out something like
    "Friday, September 29, 2023" in the template. If you would like to use the same functionality in the component
    class code, you can inject the <code>DatePipe</code> and then call the <code>transform</code> method manually.
  </p>

  <h4 class="codetitle">Component example:</h4>
  <pre><code class="language-ts line-numbers">import { DatePipe } from '@angular/common';

@Component({
  ...
  template: `{{currentDate | date : "fullDate"}}`
  imports: [DatePipe],
  standalone: true,
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  constructor(public currentDate = new Date()) {
    const formattedDate = inject(DatePipe).transform(this.currentDate, 'fullDate');
    console.log(formattedDate);
  }
}</code></pre>

  <p class="alert alert--info">
    <strong>Note:</strong> This is not the way I would personally recommend to reuse the functionality of any
    (Angular build-in) pipe. Continue reading to find out why there are better ways.
  </p>

  <h3 id="injection-context">Injection Context</h3>

  <p>
    This method can only be used wherever you are in your code that has an
    <a href="https://angular.io/guide/dependency-injection-context" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Injection Context</a>.
    You could use the <code>runInInjectionContext</code> function to make sure you have access to the right providers,
    but still you would need access to the right injector.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another way would be to manually instantiate the <code>DatePipe</code> class. In that case you probably
    need the applicable <code>LOCALE_ID</code> of your application, leading to again, needing the right
    injection context. ü§∑üèº

  <h3 id="angular-build-in-pipes">Angular build-in Pipes</h3>

  <p>
    Next to providing common functionality
    like <a href="https://angular.io/guide/pipes-overview#built-in-pipes" target="_blank">formatting dates, percentages,
    currencies or numbers</a> through pipes, Angular also exposes the inner working of those pipes directly as pure
    functions. For example, considering the use case from above, where we injected the <code>DatePipe</code> to be
    able to use the <code>transform</code> method, can be rewritten as follows:
  </p>

  <h4 class="codetitle">Component example, with formatDate:</h4>
  <pre><code class="language-ts line-numbers">import { formatDate } from '@angular/common';

@Component({
    ...
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  constructor(){
    const formattedDate = formatDate(currentDate, 'fullDate');
    console.log(formattedDate);
  }
}</code></pre>

  <p>
    We don't even need to inject the <code>DatePipe</code> anymore, because the <code>formatDate</code> is
    exposed as a pure function directly. But we still need to get the applicable <code>LOCALE_ID</code> somehow. So in
    this particular case, we can't get around needing the injection context.
  </p>

  <h3 id="custom-pipes">Custom Pipes</h3>

  <p>
    When creating your own custom pipes for your applications and having the same need to reuse the functionality of
    the <code>transform</code> method, it's better to start with an external function first. This way you can easily
    use and test this function on its own:
  </p>

  <h4 class="codetitle">sum-of-numbers.ts</h4>
  <pre><code class="language-ts line-numbers">export function sumOfNumbers(listOfNumbers: number[]): number {
  return listOfNumbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
}</code></pre>

  <h4 class="codetitle">sum-of-numbers.spec.ts</h4>
  <pre><code class="language-ts line-numbers">describe('sumOfNumbers', () => {
  it('should return the sum of all numbers in the list', () => {
    const listOfNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    const result = sumOfNumbers(listOfNumbers);
    expect(result).toBe(15);
  });
});
</code></pre>

  <h4 class="codetitle">sum-of-numbers.pipe.ts</h4>
  <pre><code class="language-ts line-numbers">import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';

@Pipe({
  name: 'sumOfNumbers',
  standalone: true,
})
export class SumOfNumbersPipe implements PipeTransform {
    transform(listOfNumbers: number[]): number {
    return sumOfNumbers(listOfNumbers);
  }
}
// no need to test this pipe, as it's just a wrapper around the function
// and you would be testing instantiating a class, which is not necessary
</code></pre>

  <p>
    Now that we have the function and its test covered, we can wrap it in a pipe. This way we can still use the function
    in our component class code, but also in our templates.
  </p>

  <h4 class="codetitle">Example component:</h4>
  <pre><code class="language-ts line-numbers">import { SumOfNumbersPipe } from './sum-of-numbers.pipe';
import { sumOfNumbers } from './sum-of-numbers';

@Component({
  ...
  template: `{{listOfNumbers | sumOfNumbers}}`
  imports: [SumOfNumbersPipe],
  standalone: true,
})
export class ExampleComponent {
    constructor(public listOfNumbers = [1, 2, 3]) {
    console.log(sumOfNumbers(this.listOfNumbers));
  }
}</code></pre>
  <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

  <p>
    There is no wrong or right way of reusing the functionality of any (Angular build-in) pipe.
    It all depends on personal or project-specific preference and how your applications are structured.
    But at least now you know how I would do it, and I honestly believe it's a better way :).
