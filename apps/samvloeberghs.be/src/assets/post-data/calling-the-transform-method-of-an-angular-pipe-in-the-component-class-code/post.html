  <p>
    This article is intended to help anybody that is looking for ways to call the transform method in the
    component class code or in any other TypeScript code that has an Injection Context.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will also learn  some other tips & tricks on how to design pipes and how to test them in
    those particular cases.
  </p>

  <h2 id="step-by-step">Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    There are several cases where you would want to reuse the functionality of a pipe in your component class code.
    The most simple example is formatting dates in an Angular component's template. The DatePipe is imported in the
    providers of the component and then used by piping the value.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, <code>{{currentDate | date : "fullDate"}}</code> would print out something like "Friday, September 29, 2023" in the template.
    If you would like to use the same functionality in the component class code, you can inject the DatePipe and then call the transform method manually.
  </p>

  <h4 class="codetitle">Component example:</h4>
  <pre><code class="language-ts line-numbers">import { DatePipe } from '@angular/common';

@Component({
  ...
  providers: [DatePipe]
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  constructor(){
    const currentDate = new Date();
    const formattedDate = inject(DatePipe).transform(currentDate, 'fullDate');
    console.log(formattedDate);
  }
}</code></pre>

    <strong>Note:</strong> This is however not the way I would personally recommend to reuse the functionality of any
    (Angular build-in) pipe. Continue reading to find out better ways.

  <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

  <p>
    There is no wrong or right way of reusing the functionality of any (Angular build-in) pipe.
    It all depends on personal or project-specific preference.
    But at least now you know how I would do it, and I do believe it's the best way :)
