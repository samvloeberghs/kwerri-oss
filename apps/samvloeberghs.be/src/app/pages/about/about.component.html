<h2 id="education">Education</h2>

<p>
  I'm educated as an Engineer in Computer Science at the
  <a href="https://www.ugent.be/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Ghent</a> but learned my true passion,
  <em>frontend web technologies</em>, totally in my spare time. I'm playing around with websites since the age of 16 and
  still love it!
</p>
<p>
  Besides that I tried to <em>understand the business side & the connection with IT </em>a little bit more by attending
  an <a href="http://www.antwerpmanagementschool.be/en/program/executive-master-enterprise-it-architecture/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">Executive master in Enterprise IT Architecture</a> at <a
  href="http://www.antwerpmanagementschool.be/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Antwerp Management School</a>. I didn't
  finish all modules because of changing interest.
